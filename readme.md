# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project is an analysis of Ride Shares done by PyBer in three different City Types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). 

### Results
The results provided are for the four months of the year (2019). The most popular and highest grossing area is in the Urban area. The peak for all three city types is between Feb and Mar. A second peak is in mid-March.

### Summary
The recommendation would be to look at what caused these peaks to see if they can be replicated throughout the year. A second recommendation is to continue to monitor these trends throughout the year to see if there are any anomolies.
